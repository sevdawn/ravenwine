Welcome to Sevdawn Photography! This page is to highlight just some of the crazy stories I have regarding the many concerts I've attended over the years and the pics I've been able to take.  (In case you're wondering, our last show before covid19 lockdown was Nov 11, 2019 Slayer's farewell show here in Louisville, KY which feels like a LIFETIME ago now) I say all the time, I'm not a pro, just a fan with a smartphone. ALL of the images (except the metalmealmeltdown image on the main page and the pic in the modal on the main page) were taken by me with my cellphone over the year and edited in GIMP, my go to photo editor. 

The first page you see, my home page, has three buttons 'Crazy Stories' takes you to a Bootstrap styled page with 6 cards, each card telling a different story from my 
concert experiences. Bootstrap on home/about pages is loaded by CDN (CSS Feature requirement)  Clicking on an image brings it up full size and you can click the directional arrows to see the other images. The middle button, 'Meet the Bard of the Freakshow' is a modal button that brings up my social media profile pic taken by tour photographer Brian Kuhn. Clicking on 'Gallery' takes you to a Jquery powered gallery of just a few of the hundreds of pics I've taken over the years at shows. In the upper right hand corner, I have Home/About/Contact menu complete with hamburger menu item (CSS Feature requirement). I don't have anything on Contact page. The About page has a small descriptive paragraph and a modal which opens up and has buttons to take you to my Twitch page, Twitter, and Instagram. (Modal buttons meet Javascript features requirement)
